## Project Overview

This repository provides a simple, production-minded REST API for managing products in an e-commerce scenario. It focuses on core features such as listing products, retrieving a single product, creating products (with image upload support), rating products, and filtering/sorting.

The codebase is intentionally minimal so it can be used as a learning reference, a starting point for a larger project, or as the backend for a demo storefront.

## Features

* CRUD-like operations for products
* Single product retrieval
* Product rating endpoint
* File upload support for product images
* Basic filtering and sorting endpoints

## Tech Stack

* Node.js
* Express
* [multer] for handling file uploads (disk storage)
* Any JSON-compatible database (MongoDB, lowdb, or similar) — adapt the data layer as needed

> The repository is JavaScript-first (ES modules) and structured for clarity.

## API Endpoints (examples)

These are the main endpoints the repository exposes. Exact paths may vary slightly depending on your implementation; check `src` for the definitive routes.

* `GET /products` — Get all products (supports query params for filtering/pagination)
* `GET /products/:id` — Get single product by id
* `POST /products` — Add a new product (multipart/form-data to upload image)
* `POST /products/:id/rate` — Rate a product
* `GET /products/filter` — Filter products by fields (category, price range, rating, etc.)

> See `ApiList.txt` in the repository for a raw list of implemented APIs.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14+ recommended)
* npm or yarn
* A database (MongoDB recommended) or use a simple JSON store for quick local testing

### Install

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/Faisalsaificode/E-commerce_RestAPI.git
cd E-commerce_RestAPI

# install
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (example variables):

```
PORT=3200
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret   # if you add auth later
```

Make sure the `UPLOAD_DIR` exists (the repository contains an `uploads/` folder but verify permissions).

### Run

```bash
# start
node server.js
# or if you use npm scripts
npm start
```

By default the sample server runs on the port printed to the console (e.g. `3200`).

## File uploads

The project uses `multer` disk storage for uploads. Uploaded files are placed in the `uploads/` directory. Filenames are typically prefixed with timestamps to avoid collisions.

If you want cloud storage, replace the `multer` storage engine with an S3 / Cloud Storage adapter.

## Project Structure (high level)

```
E-commerce_RestAPI/
├─ src/
│  ├─ features/
│  │  ├─ product/    # product model, controller, routes
│  ├─ middlewares/   # auth, error handlers, upload config
│  └─ index.js / app.js
├─ uploads/          # uploaded images
├─ server.js
├─ package.json
└─ ApiList.txt
```

Adjust structure to your taste — grouping routes, services, and models into clear domains helps maintainability.

## Testing

There are no automated tests included by default. To add tests, consider using:

* Jest + Supertest for API integration tests
* ESLint + Prettier for consistent code style

## Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! A simple workflow:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`feature/awesome`)
3. Open a pull request describing your change

Keep changes focused and include tests where possible.

## Troubleshooting & Notes

* If `multer` filename collisions occur, ensure you generate unique filenames (timestamp + original name or UUID).
* If you encounter `TypeError: product.push is not a function`, inspect where `product` is expected to be an array but is a single object or an unexpected type. Ensure model methods return arrays when the controller expects them.
* Check `server.js` if you see port or startup issues — ensure environment variables are loaded correctly.

If you'd like, I can scan the repository and add more specific details (exact dependencies, example requests/responses, sample `.env`, or Postman collection).

## License

This project currently has no license file. Add a `LICENSE` (MIT is common for demos) if you want to permit reuse.
